1. write a js promise library 

2. use database to store character, image and sound
	1) use database to store character(utf8)
	2) use file system to store image and sound (relational database is not a good place to store file)
	3) use database to store character, image and sound relationship
	4) need to consider migration (from one machine to another)
	5) need to consider user(support users in the future)

	Principle:
	1. manange change, because database will change always
	2. once the script is committed to the Source Version Control Tool (git), the script must not be modified.
	3. use table SchemaChange(ScriptName, MajorReleaseNumber, MinorReleaseNumber, BuildNumber, DateApplied) to track build version history
	4. each time we run update database tool, the tool will compare DBMaxBuildNumber (the max build number in SchemaChange table) 
	   with SrcMaxBuildNumber (the max build number in file system), if the SrcMaxBuildNumber is greater, 
	   the tool will run the added scripts in the file system to update the database.
	5. each script has prefix to mark the execution sequence, name to explain script purpose, seperator to seperate prefix and name. 
	   Prefix format: MajorReleaseNumber.MinorReleaseNumber.BuildNumber, for example: 0.0.4
	   Seperator: hyphen(-)
	   For example 0.0.4-WordSound.sql means this script is in the 4th execution position

3. write unit test

4. compute md5 of image/sound file, then store the md5 in database
   file data is stored in file system, if md5 is j4k0k306jw99j6h0jhhm2nb46bvuyo5qe, 
   the file path is root_dir/j4/k0/j4k0k306jw99j6h0jhhm2nb46bvuyo5qe

5. support hundreds of thousands of users
	how to pass user info to service, to database
	parameter? 
	context? 
	parameter object?

	how to dependency injection in python?
	constructor?
	setter?

6. when user view one character, 
    if the user does not bind image to this character,
	display the default image(s).
	if the user bind some image to this character,
	display the custom image(s) in high priority.

7. record each character learning datetime for analysing learning habit and improve performance

8. compute best in-learning count for each user according the user's learning history

9. get sound for each character

10. generate different sizes of photos automatically

11. support taking photo from Phone and Pad

12. support cache because wireless is very slow
