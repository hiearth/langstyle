1. write a js promise library 

2. use database to store character, image and sound
	1) use database to store character(utf8)
	2) use file system to store image and sound (relational database is not a good place to store file)
	3) use database to store character, image and sound relationship
	4) need to consider migration (from one machine to another)
	5) need to consider user(support users in the future)

	Version 1:
	Character (CharacterId, Code, LanguageId)
	Language (LanguageId, Name) # Name need localization when display in page
	Image (CharacterId, Path) # Path is a relative path generated by image storage
	Sound (CharacterId, Path) # Path is a relative path generated by sound storage

	Principle:
	1. manange change, because database will change always
	2. script can only be append, must not modify or delete original script when update
	3. use table SchemaChange(ScriptName, MD5, Length, DateApplied) to track changes
		MD5 can be used to check whether the script is updated or not
		Length is used to check whether modify/delete original script, because script is only allowed to add,
		Version Control Tool(git) can be used to store history, so we can re-build database at some past moment
	4. Each time we want to upgrade database, the db install tool will compare scripts in file system 
	   and the records in SchemaChange table, if the MD5 is not equal, we think the script need to update to database
	   for example: TableName1.sql(md5 = 03495jjjdp994jwlelejlse99349f3334) in file system
					TableName1.sql(md5 = 0l49994rjdp994jwlelejlse99349f399) in database
					we need to run TableName1.sql to update it.
					Before we do the update, we need to make sure the script only adds more sql statement without modifying original statements.
					First compute the md5 of truncated content from start to length position of the updated script,
					then compare this computed md5 to the md5 in the table record.
					If the two md5 are not equal, we must not update the updated script.

3. get sound for each character

4. generate different sizes of photos automatically

5. support taking photo from Phone and Pad

6. support cache because wireless is very slow
